              Goal: To have correct sat channels included in 1012 Glonass messages.
              Issue:  Identified by decoding messages using gpsd's "gpsdecode" utility.
                      1012 messages contain a channel number prior to being decoded with str2str, but are assigned
                      null value -7 after encoding via rtcm3e.c
              
                      Problem was found to be in the way the channel number is assigned to the variable 'fcn' in 1012
                      message. The vaule of "freq" assigned in the rtcm3.c decoder is not passed to a constant for rtcm3e.c 
                      to use in the encoding process.
              Fix Summary:  * added new integer constant to obsd_t in rtklib.h.
                            * in rtcm3.c, staticaly assign decoded value of 'freq' to this obsd_t constant.
                            * in rtcm3e.c, statically assign value of obsd_t 'freq' constant to 'fcn' instead of 
                            relying on the 1020 ephemerides method used in original code.
